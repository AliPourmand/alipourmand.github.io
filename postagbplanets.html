							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I am currently working on the theoretical prospects of planet formation in post-AGB disks, disks formed around binary systems with an evolved "post-AGB" star. The motivation for our study is the multitude of similarities these second-generation disks show compared to disks around young stars which are known to be the planet nurseries. However the exotic environments of our second-generation disks makes it an unknown territory to test our current theories of planet formation. <br>
							We have started this project by first investigating whether gravitational instabilities can cause post-AGB disks to fragment under there own gravity and form "clumps" which then collapse further to make planets. This project is under the supervision of Orsola De Marco and Devika Kamath, and involves combining theory and simulations with observational work. We use analytical estimates to outline the expectations of our disks, and then use the PHANTOM SPH code to simulate these disks in detail. Our analytical and computational efforts are deeply motivated by and constrained with observational insights we gain primarily through collaborating with my primary supervisor's research group. </p>

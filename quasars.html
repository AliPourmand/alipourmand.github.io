							<p>"Standard candles" are astronomical phenomena whose distances we can easily measure, and are useful as they can then serve as yardsticks to measure distances in the universe. The reason is usually due to the fact that we have a good understanding of how bright these objects intrinsically are, which we can then use to find their distances based on how dim or bright they "apparently" seem.
									The first objects used (by Hubble and Humason) to determine cosmological distances were Cepheid Variables, which was thanks to Henrietta Swan Leavitt who found a clever way to find their intrinsic brightnesses.
									More recently Supernovae have also been used as standard candles, which have served to discover the fact that the universe is accelerating in its expansion. <br>
									A new set of objects that can be potentially used as "standard candles" are quasars, which are active galactic nuclei, and are observable at much further distances than Supernovae and Cepheid variables. This means they could be used to probe information about the universe from much earlier times than what other "standard candles" can give us. 
									In our project, we have attempted to use a catalog of these objects and find what they predict for the free parameters of a certain modified cosmological model. My contribution to this project was on cosmological data analysis which involved working with the Monte Carlo code emcee.<p>
